# Reflection

1. What was the most challenging part of translating from Python concepts to Java syntax?

The most challenging part for me was doing math with different types because I am not used to implicit conversion and casting.

2. When did you use AI assistance and what did it help you with?

I had to use google Gemini to because there was an error message saying `error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int`. I didn't know what that meant so I had to search it up on google.

3. Was there anything in Java that you liked better than in Python?

I liked the syntax of Java in general better than Python with curly brackets, and parenthesis around conditions. Additionally, I liked that you can use `i++;` instead of `i += 1` in Python.
